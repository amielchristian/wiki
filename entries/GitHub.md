# GitHub

GitHub is a web-based platform for version control and collaboration that is primarily used for hosting and managing software projects. It provides a centralized location where developers can store, share, and collaborate on their code.

At its core, GitHub uses a distributed version control system called [Git](/wiki/Git). Git allows developers to track changes to their code over time, making it easier to manage and coordinate work in a collaborative environment. With Git, developers can create branches to work on different features or bug fixes, and later merge those changes back into the main codebase.

GitHub provides a user-friendly interface on top of Git, making it accessible to developers of all skill levels. It offers features like pull requests, issue tracking, project management tools, and code review capabilities, which facilitate collaboration and help teams work together more effectively.

GitHub is widely used in the software development community, both by individual developers and by organizations of all sizes. It has become a popular platform for open-source projects, allowing developers from around the world to contribute to and improve upon existing software. Additionally, many companies use GitHub for their private repositories to manage their proprietary code and enable collaboration among their development teams.

In addition to hosting code repositories, GitHub also supports various other types of content, such as documentation, wikis, and websites. It has a robust ecosystem of integrations and extensions, enabling developers to connect their GitHub repositories with other tools and services to enhance their development workflows.

In summary, GitHub is a web-based platform that leverages the power of Git for version control and provides a collaborative environment for developers to work on software projects, whether open source or private.
